# My-SQL
Airline Reservation System in SQL using Dummy Data
An Airline Reservation System is a database application that allows users to book, cancel, and manage flight reservations. Using MySQL, we can simulate such a system by designing tables, inserting dummy data, and writing SQL queries to perform typical operations.
Conclusion
An Airline Reservation System in MySQL using dummy data is a great way to practice:

Database design and normalization

CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

SQL joins and constraints

Building real-world logic (e.g., booking vs canceling a seat)

This kind of project is ideal for students, beginners, and database enthusiasts looking to apply SQL in a realistic scenario.
